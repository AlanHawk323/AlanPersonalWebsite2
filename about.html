        When I'm not in this class learning about functions, commands, or raging over how my CSS just doesn't 
        look right, I spend my time writing fanfiction and publishing it on the Internet. Nearly all of my 
        recent stories have been based on the anime series Yugioh VRAINS, a show that may or may not have been 
        a slight influence on me deciding to sign up for this class. I had other reasons: wanting to advance 
        my career, my dad already working in the field, feeling like it would be a better fit for me, and of
        course a genuine interest in learning to code, but I'd be lying if I said that watching an entire 120
        episode show all the way through twice where all the main characters are either hackers or sentient AIs
        and everything is done through futuristic technology didn't also help pique my interest.

        My Github and Slack profile pictures respectively. They're sentient AIs from Yugioh VRAINS. So... living 
        lines of programming basically. I don't know, I thought it was clever.

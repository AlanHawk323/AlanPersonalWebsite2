        <h3> I've learned a little more since making that first website, including how much I despise CSS.
            Speaking, the two most annoying things in the universe: </h3>
            <!-- This box is supposed to be centered. I did my best.-->
    <h1 class="container">
        The first one is CSS. As you can see, this text is in a box. A light green box with a thick red border.
        This was done exclusively in CSS, also known as the biggest pain ever. It took me forever to make this
        look the way I wanted.
    </h1>
    <div>
        <h1> And the second you may ask? The second one is him: </h1>
        <!-- This image is intentionally off centre -->

            <div>
            Why? Because they're both the most stubborn unreasonable things on the planet that are only good
            for look pretty (yes I'm gay). The difference is that CSS eventually comes around or you can at
            least find a middle ground with it. There is no middle ground with this guy, so I'm not going to
            bother centering him as a visual depiction of that point.
